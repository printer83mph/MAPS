## Instructions

### How do I start???

Open index.html. Double clicking it should work, but if it doesn't open with whatever browser you want to use. Remember that this is a browser based program, so refreshing the page should fix any issues that pop up.

### How do I do things???

*Note: If any of these don't work, click inside the browser window to make sure your keyboard is recognized.*

* Use F to create a ball of random mass at your mouse location. Don't worry, they all have the same density, so you can tell their mass by their size.
* Press R over a ball to remove it, and C to remove all balls from the screen.
* Click and hold on a ball to grab hold of it, the force applied on it is relative to the distance from the center of it to your mouse.

### What do the lines mean???

* Red is acceleration, so if you're not dragging the ball, it'll just be some downwards force from gravity.
* Blue is velocity, this will change depending on the speed and direction of the ball.
* Black is the grabber line from your mouse to the ball, the longer it is the harder it pulls the ball.



## Notes

### Accurate Physics

I tried to make the physics as realistic as possible, here are some examples of realistic physics in the program.

* The balls change direction and loses some speed when bouncing off a wall - they lose energy
* When rolling on the ground, the balls lose speed faster than when in the air - friction
* A ball will be harder to pull up if it is larger and consequently has more mass (they are all the same density) - inertia

### Inaccurate Physics

Of course there are parts of the program that are unrealistic.

* When rolling on the ground the slowing down doesn't change the red line
* The ball doesn't squish on a wall and take time to bounce off
* NO SOUND EFFECTS!!! (yet)

I said mostly, didn't I?
